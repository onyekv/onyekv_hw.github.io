Hi! My name is **Onyeka**. I will be getting my Masters in Public Health [Epidemiology w/ Advanced Certificate in Applied Biostats and Public Health Data Science from Columbia University.</p>

<p class="text-muted">
I really enjoy coding and continuing to learn about R. Outside of building myself as an aspiring Data Scientist, I love to take photos. I haven't taken any in quite sometime now, but I'm hoping as a phase out of academia, I can spend more time developing my hobby.
Anyways, click the menu button to learn more about me! </p>
